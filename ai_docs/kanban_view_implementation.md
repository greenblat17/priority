# Kanban View Implementation Log

## Overview
Implemented a Kanban board view for the Tasks section, providing users with a visual workflow management interface alongside the existing table view.

## Implementation Date
2025-08-02

## Features Implemented

### 1. View Toggle Component (`/src/components/tasks/view-toggle.tsx`)
- Created a toggle component with Table and Kanban icons
- Uses Radix UI toggle group for accessibility
- Integrated with existing filter persistence system
- Clean, minimal design matching the app's aesthetic

### 2. Kanban Board Component (`/src/components/tasks/task-kanban-view.tsx`)
- 4-column layout representing task statuses:
  - **Pending** (yellow background)
  - **In Progress** (blue background)
  - **Completed** (green background)
  - **Blocked** (red background)
- Responsive grid layout (stacks on mobile, 2 columns on tablet, 4 on desktop)
- ScrollArea for each column to handle many tasks

### 3. Drag and Drop Functionality
- Native HTML5 drag and drop API implementation
- Visual feedback during drag operations:
  - Dragged card becomes semi-transparent
  - Drop target column gets a primary color ring
- Automatic status update when dropping in a new column
- Optimistic updates using existing mutation hooks

### 4. Task Cards Design
- Compact card layout showing all essential information:
  - Task description (truncated with ellipsis)
  - Source label
  - Category badge with color coding
  - Priority indicator (P1-P10 with semantic colors)
  - Complexity indicator (easy/medium/hard)
  - Estimated hours
  - Confidence score badge with warning icon for low confidence
  - Group badge if task belongs to a group
- Grip handle icon for visual drag affordance
- Dropdown menu for actions (same as table view)

### 5. View Persistence
- Extended `useFilterPersistence` hook to include view preference
- Added `view: 'table' | 'kanban'` to FilterState interface
- View preference saved to localStorage
- Defaults to table view for backward compatibility

### 6. Integration with Task List
- Updated `TaskList` component to conditionally render views
- View toggle placed in header next to Groups and Export buttons
- All existing filters, search, and sorting work with both views
- Bulk selection only available in table view (as intended)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies Added
```json
"@radix-ui/react-toggle": "^1.x.x",
"@radix-ui/react-toggle-group": "^1.x.x"
```

### New Components Created
1. `/src/components/tasks/task-kanban-view.tsx` - Main Kanban board component
2. `/src/components/tasks/view-toggle.tsx` - View switcher component
3. `/src/components/ui/toggle-group.tsx` - Reusable toggle group component
4. `/src/components/ui/toggle.tsx` - Base toggle component

### Modified Files
1. `/src/hooks/use-filter-persistence.ts` - Added view preference storage
2. `/src/components/tasks/task-list.tsx` - Integrated view toggle and conditional rendering
3. `/src/components/tasks/confidence-badge.tsx` - Added size prop for smaller badges in cards
4. `/src/lib/supabase/service.ts` - Fixed import path for database types

## Design Decisions

### Visual Design
- Used subtle background colors for status columns (10% opacity in dark mode)
- Maintained consistent spacing and typography with existing design
- Cards use same visual hierarchy as table rows
- Minimalist approach with focus on content

### UX Decisions
- Drag and drop as primary interaction for status changes
- Dropdown menu preserved for all other actions
- Empty state message for columns with no tasks
- Visual drag handle to indicate draggable elements
- Smooth transitions and hover states

### Technical Decisions
- Used native HTML5 drag and drop (no external library)
- Leveraged existing hooks and mutations for data updates
- Maintained separation of concerns with dedicated components
- Progressive enhancement - falls back gracefully if drag fails

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
- Task reordering within columns
- Column collapse/expand
- Swimlanes by category or group
- Card size options (compact/normal/expanded)
- Keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Touch gesture support for mobile

## Testing Performed
- View toggle functionality and persistence
- Drag and drop between all column combinations
- Filter and search compatibility
- Responsive layout on different screen sizes
- Edge cases (empty columns, single task, many tasks)
- Integration with existing features

## Performance Considerations
- Cards are rendered efficiently with minimal re-renders
- Drag operations use optimistic updates
- ScrollArea prevents layout shift with many tasks
- View preference loaded from localStorage synchronously

## Accessibility
- Toggle buttons have proper ARIA labels
- Cards maintain keyboard accessibility
- Screen reader support through semantic HTML
- Color is not the only indicator (text labels present)

## Summary
The Kanban view implementation provides users with an alternative visual interface for managing tasks while maintaining full feature parity with the table view. The implementation follows the app's design principles of simplicity, functionality, and modern aesthetics.
