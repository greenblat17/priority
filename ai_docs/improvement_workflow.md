  - Batch status updates (partially implemented)

## Phase 2: AI & Intelligence Improvements (Priority: High)

### 2.1 Enhanced Duplicate Detection

- **Implement Embedding-Based Similarity** (PRD requirement)
  - Currently missing cosine similarity calculation
  - Add OpenAI embedding generation
  - Cache embeddings for performance
- **Improve Grouping Algorithm**
  - Add confidence scores to duplicates
  - Allow manual merge/unmerge of tasks
  - Show similarity percentage in UI

### 2.2 AI Analysis Improvements

- **Add Confidence Scores** (PRD Phase 2 feature) [DONE]
  - Display AI confidence in categorization
  - Flag low-confidence tasks for review
- **Improve Implementation Specs**
  - Add more detailed technical specifications
  - Include code snippets and examples
  - Tailor specs to detected tech stack

## Phase 3: Performance & Scalability (Priority: Medium)

### 3.1 Backend Optimization

- **Implement Proper Queue System**
  - Add BullMQ/Redis for background processing
  - Move AI analysis to queue workers
  - Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Database Optimization**
  - Add indexes for common queries
  - Implement pagination properly (currently basic)
  - Add caching layer for frequent queries

### 3.2 Frontend Performance

- **Implement Virtual Scrolling**
  - For large task lists (100+ items)
  - Reduce DOM nodes and improve rendering
- **Add Progressive Enhancement**
  - Service worker for offline capability
  - PWA features for mobile experience

## Phase 4: User Experience Enhancements (Priority: Medium)

### 4.1 Dashboard Improvements

- **Add Analytics Dashboard** (PRD Phase 2 feature)
  - Task completion trends
  - Category distribution charts
  - Time-to-completion metrics
- **Implement Advanced Filtering**
  - Multi-select filters
  - Date range filtering
  - Custom filter combinations

### 4.2 Mobile Experience

- **Responsive Design Improvements**
  - Currently desktop-first, needs mobile optimization
  - Touch-friendly interactions
  - Swipe gestures for task actions

### 4.3 Keyboard Navigation

- **Complete Keyboard Shortcuts**
  - J/K navigation (mentioned in PRD)
  - Quick status changes
  - Search focus shortcuts

## Phase 5: Security & Compliance (Priority: High)

### 5.1 Security Enhancements

- **Implement Rate Limiting**
  - API endpoint protection
  - Prevent abuse of AI analysis
- **Add Input Validation**
  - Sanitize all user inputs
  - Implement CSRF protection
- **Enhance Data Encryption**
  - Encrypt sensitive task data
  - Secure API key storage

### 5.2 Compliance Features

- **GDPR Compliance** (PRD requirement)
  - Data export functionality
  - Account deletion (hard delete)
  - Privacy policy implementation
- **Add Audit Logging**
  - Track all data access
  - Log user actions for security

## Phase 6: Testing & Quality (Priority: High)

### 6.1 Test Coverage

- **Add Unit Tests**
  - Currently no test files found
  - Target 80% code coverage
  - Test critical business logic
- **Add Integration Tests**
  - API endpoint testing
  - Database transaction tests
  - Queue system tests

### 6.2 E2E Testing

- **Implement Playwright Tests**
  - User journey testing
  - Cross-browser compatibility
  - Mobile device testing

## Phase 7: Documentation & Onboarding (Priority: Medium)

### 7.1 User Documentation

- **Create Help Center**
  - How-to guides
  - Video tutorials
  - FAQ section
- **Improve Onboarding**
  - Interactive tour for new users
  - Sample tasks for testing
  - Best practices guide

### 7.2 Developer Documentation

- **API Documentation**
  - OpenAPI/Swagger specs
  - Integration guides
  - Webhook documentation

## Quick Wins (Can implement immediately)

1. **Fix Node.js Version Warning**
   - Update to Node.js 20+ for Next.js compatibility
2. **Add Loading States**
   - Skeleton screens for better perceived performance
   - Progress indicators for AI analysis
3. **Improve Error Messages**
   - More helpful error descriptions
   - Recovery suggestions
4. **Add Success Metrics**
   - Track feature usage
   - Monitor AI analysis accuracy
   - User satisfaction metrics

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Remove Debug Endpoints**
   - `/api/debug-tasks` should not be in production
2. **Standardize Error Handling**
   - Consistent error format across API
   - Better error logging
3. **Optimize Bundle Size**
   - Code splitting for routes
   - Lazy load heavy components
4. **Update Dependencies**
   - Keep packages up to date
   - Security vulnerability scanning

This workflow prioritizes features based on the PRD requirements, current implementation gaps, and potential business impact. Each phase can be broken down into specific tasks and implemented incrementally.
