# Phase 3.1 Testing Guide - Duplicate Detection

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for the Duplicate Detection feature implemented in Phase 3.1. The feature uses OpenAI embeddings to identify similar tasks and prevent duplicates.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure you're on the latest code
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Verify Configuration
- ✅ OpenAI API key is set in `.env.local`
- ✅ Supabase is configured and running
- ✅ You're logged in to the application
- ✅ You have some existing tasks in your account

### 3. Create Test Data
Before testing duplicate detection, create these baseline tasks:

1. **Bug Task**: "Fix payment processing error when users try to upgrade to premium"
2. **Feature Task**: "Add dark mode toggle to the settings page"
3. **Improvement Task**: "Improve dashboard loading performance"
4. **Business Task**: "Create marketing campaign for Black Friday"

## Test Scenarios

### 🧪 Test 1: Exact Duplicate Detection

**Objective**: Verify that exact duplicates are detected with ~100% similarity

**Steps**:
1. Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) to open Quick-Add Modal
2. Enter: "Fix payment processing error when users try to upgrade to premium"
3. Click "Add Task"
4. **Expected Result**: 
   - Duplicate review dialog appears
   - Shows existing task with 95-100% match
   - Red badge indicating high similarity

**Verification**:
- [ ] Dialog shows the duplicate
- [ ] Similarity score is ≥95%
- [ ] All action buttons work (Create anyway, View existing, Cancel)

### 🧪 Test 2: Similar Task Detection (Minor Variations)

**Objective**: Test detection of tasks with slight wording differences

**Test Cases**:

#### Case A: Synonyms
- Original: "Add dark mode toggle to the settings page"
- Test: "Implement dark theme switch in settings"
- Expected: 85-95% match

#### Case B: Additional Details
- Original: "Improve dashboard loading performance"
- Test: "Improve dashboard loading performance by implementing lazy loading"
- Expected: 90-95% match

#### Case C: Different Phrasing
- Original: "Fix payment processing error when users try to upgrade to premium"
- Test: "Users can't upgrade to premium - payment fails"
- Expected: 85-90% match

**Steps**:
1. Open Quick-Add Modal
2. Enter each test variation
3. Verify duplicate dialog appears
4. Check similarity scores

### 🧪 Test 3: Non-Duplicate Verification

**Objective**: Ensure unrelated tasks don't trigger false positives

**Test Cases**:
1. "Implement user authentication with OAuth"
2. "Add export functionality for reports"
3. "Create API documentation"
4. "Set up automated testing"

**Expected Result**: 
- No duplicate dialog appears
- Task creates immediately
- Quick success toast notification

### 🧪 Test 4: Edge Cases

#### A. Empty or Very Short Descriptions
1. Try submitting: "Fix bug"
2. Try submitting: "Update"
3. **Expected**: Either no duplicates or low similarity scores

#### B. Special Characters and Formatting
1. Try: "Fix bug: app crashes when uploading files > 10MB"
2. Try: "Add feature - users want @mentions in comments!"
3. Try: "Implement (urgent) payment processing // HIGH PRIORITY"
4. **Expected**: Duplicate detection works despite special characters

#### C. Very Long Descriptions
1. Copy and paste a 500+ character description
2. **Expected**: Duplicate detection still functions correctly

#### D. Multiple Languages
1. Try: "Implementar modo oscuro" (Spanish)
2. Try: "ダークモードを追加" (Japanese)
3. **Expected**: System handles gracefully (may not detect cross-language duplicates)

### 🧪 Test 5: User Flow Testing

#### A. Create Anyway Flow
1. Trigger duplicate detection
2. Click "Create New Task Anyway"
3. **Verify**:
   - [ ] Task is created
   - [ ] Modal closes
   - [ ] Task appears in list
   - [ ] Success toast shows

#### B. View Existing Flow
1. Trigger duplicate detection
2. Select a duplicate task
3. Click "View Selected Task"
4. **Verify**:
   - [ ] Redirects to tasks page
   - [ ] Modal closes
   - [ ] No new task created

#### C. Cancel Flow
1. Trigger duplicate detection
2. Click "Cancel"
3. **Verify**:
   - [ ] Returns to Quick-Add Modal
   - [ ] Form data preserved
   - [ ] Can modify and resubmit

### 🧪 Test 6: Performance Testing

#### A. Response Time
1. Enter a task description
2. Click "Add Task"
3. **Measure**: Time until duplicate dialog appears
4. **Expected**: < 3 seconds

#### B. Multiple Rapid Submissions
1. Create 5 tasks in quick succession
2. **Verify**: All duplicate checks complete
3. **Expected**: No errors or timeouts

### 🧪 Test 7: Error Handling

#### A. Network Failure
1. Open DevTools Network tab
2. Set to "Offline"
3. Try creating a task
4. **Expected**: 
   - Task creation proceeds without duplicate check
   - No blocking errors

#### B. API Rate Limiting
1. Create many tasks rapidly (10+)
2. **Expected**: 
   - Graceful handling if rate limited
   - Tasks still create successfully

### 🧪 Test 8: Integration Testing

#### A. With AI Analysis
1. Create a task that passes duplicate check
2. **Verify**:
   - [ ] Task is created
   - [ ] AI analysis runs
   - [ ] Both features work together

#### B. With Task Dashboard
1. After creating potential duplicates
2. Go to Tasks page
3. **Verify**:
   - [ ] All tasks display correctly
   - [ ] No duplicate-related UI issues

## Using the Test Page

### Navigate to `/test-duplicates`

This dedicated test page allows you to:

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Enter any description
   - Click "Check for Duplicates"
   - See results immediately

2. **Quick Tests**:
   - Use pre-defined test buttons
   - Test different scenarios quickly

3. **Debugging**:
   - View similarity scores
   - Check embedding generation
   - Verify API responses

### Test Page Scenarios

1. **Test Exact Match**:
   - Enter exact text of existing task
   - Should show 99-100% match

2. **Test Variations**:
   - Use test buttons 1-8
   - Create some tasks first
   - Then test similar descriptions

3. **Test Threshold**:
   - Try descriptions with 70-84% similarity
   - Should NOT appear as duplicates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "AI service not configured" Error
- **Cause**: OpenAI API key missing
- **Fix**: Check `.env.local` has valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`

#### 2. No Duplicates Detected (when expected)
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Tasks are completed/blocked (only checks active tasks)
  - Tasks older than 90 days
  - Similarity below 85% threshold
- **Debug**: Use `/test-duplicates` to check similarity scores

#### 3. False Positives
- **Cause**: Threshold too low for your use case
- **Note**: Currently set at 85% similarity

#### 4. Slow Performance
- **Causes**:
  - Many existing tasks
  - Slow API response
- **Optimization**: Tasks are filtered to last 90 days

### Debug Tips

1. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for API errors
   - Check network requests

2. **Use Network Tab**:
   - Monitor `/api/check-duplicates` calls
   - Verify response data

3. **Test Isolated Components**:
   - Use `/test-duplicates` for API testing
   - Create tasks via dashboard to isolate issues

## Success Criteria

The duplicate detection feature is working correctly when:

- ✅ Exact duplicates show >95% similarity
- ✅ Similar tasks (same intent) show 85-95% similarity
- ✅ Different tasks show <85% similarity
- ✅ UI provides clear feedback about duplicates
- ✅ Users can choose how to handle duplicates
- ✅ Performance is acceptable (<3 seconds)
- ✅ Errors don't block task creation
- ✅ Feature integrates smoothly with existing workflow
